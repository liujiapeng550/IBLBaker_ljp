These reference .ma files were created in Maya 2012.
They should open in pretty much any other version of Maya.
They will require some fixing after loading.

1.) Only open from inside maya. Double clicking on the file in explorer will fail due to Maya not loading the cgfx plugin in the correct order.
2.) Maya has problems with relative pathing and is a a little braindead in resolving cgfx file paths.
    You will need to go through all of the cgfx materials in the scene and add the fullpath for the IBLBaker/maya directory to the cgfx shader path for this reason.

You guys can do pretty much whatever you want with these files. 
Study it, kitbash it into new assets, make a lowpoly and texture it, etc. 
Just as long as you're not selling the assets as is or including them in a commercial project.
